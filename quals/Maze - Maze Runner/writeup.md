# Maze - Maze Runner - localo


**Category:** Gamehax
**Difficulty:** Medium

## Summery
The author provided a game called `maze` we have to solve some challenges to get the flags.
There is a little race we have to go quickly from checkpoint to checkpoint to solve it. 

## Solution
I wrote a shitty DLL that changes my speed and disables gravity, after that the race is quite easy to win. But since we get it for free when solving M4z3 Runn3r, see that writeup for more information on the proxy solution.
## Mitigation
- set harder limits in the anti cheat
